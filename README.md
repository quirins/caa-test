# CAA Issuance Tests

We conduct controlled experiments to analyze whether CAs hone the CAA record that has come into effect on September 8, 2017.

We conduct 1 round of tests right at CAA record effectiveness (around September 9), and a round of re-tests a month later (October 10th).

UPDATE 2017-11-23: We have identified issuance anomalies based on historic DNS records [Link](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.security.policy/QpSVjzrj7T4/d9mZOCGUAgAJ)

UPDATE 2017-11-15: DigiCert has done an extense review of our test case D2, and even identified 4 new certificates affected by the same problem. [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409735)

## Test Domain Setups

We set up several test domains to check various corner cases of CAA deployment.  
This list has some overlap with the nice work at https://caatestsuite.com/  

Zone files can be found under zonefiles/.

 


| Domain | Setup                                    | Expected CA Behavior        | FQDNs                                  | Zone                                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| D5     | www --> D1                               | Refuse                      | www.gazebear.online, www.gazebear5.com | [www.gazebear.online](http://dnsviz.net/d/www.gazebear.online/WeR_8w/dnssec/ ), [www.gazebear5.com](http://dnsviz.net/d/www.gazebear5.com/WeCB8A/dnssec/) |
| D6     | www --> www.D1                           | Refuse or Issue             | www.gazebear.pet, www.gazebear6.com    | (informational test)                     |
| D7     | hash-ca, issue permissive                | Issue                       | HASH.gazebear.site                     | (informational test)                     |
| D8     | hash-ca, issue denied                    | Reject                      | HASH.gazebear.site                     | (informational test)                     |



For case D4, RFC and CAB Ballot permit a CA to issue. However, CAs may (and maybe should) be more conservative and decide to refuse to issue after a timeout on the CAA record.

[1] More explanation on D2: The zonefile contains an "issue ;" CAA record, and all CAA replies for that zone are dropped. As the zone is signed, even in case of a non-dropped reply, no CA would be authorized to issue. 



## CA Test Results 

The table header contains the expected result.

The first result indicates the result of the first test in September 2017, the second result the re-test in October 2017. 

For example (Refused/Issued) indicates that a CA refused to issue in the first test in September, but issued in the re-test in October.

[1] Other Symantec brands with same backend as RapidSSL not tested individually. FIrst refusal might have been due to missing locality in CSR, we validated second-round CSRs using [this checker](https://cryptoreport.geotrust.com/checker/views/csrCheck.jsp)

[2] First test for D4 cancelled after 2 days in pending, likely in wake of our bug report for D2. 

[3] Due to the high cost of certificates and lengthy validation process, we only tested the basic case for DigiCert and Network Solutions.

[4] Comodo instantly reacted to our report and changed their system behaviour. An immediate re-test led to issuance 2 days later. Comodo then stated that they had to revert back to the old behavior for operational reasons.  

[5] Though SSL.com delivers Comodo certificates and uses the comodo backend, its observable behaviour differed.
